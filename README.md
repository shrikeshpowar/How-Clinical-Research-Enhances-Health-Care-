How Clinical Research Enhances Health Care?Â Clinical research is a current knowledge-intensive and booming industry. It is an industry that is growing at an astounding rate and opening up a wide scope of employment opportunities for trained people. It deals with scientific analysis of the impact, risks and benefits of medicines or a medicinal product. Trials are worked out before initiating the products in the market. The tests are performed at different stages and supervision is maintained after the launch to scrutinize the safety concerns and monitor the side effects if any.
